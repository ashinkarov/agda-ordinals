# Ordinals in Cantor Normal Form

This is an agda library implementing Ordinals in Cantor Normal Form
and a number of basic operations on them including `+`, left `-`, `*`,
`/`, `%`.

## Versions

These files rely on a pretty recent version of the agda-stdlib.
I use agda `2.6.0.1`, and the agda-stdlib at commit `e47adf6ba`.
